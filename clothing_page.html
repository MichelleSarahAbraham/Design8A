		traditional clothes which matches their vibrant culture. Their 
		traditional clothing is worn during the Fallas festival by women which 
		lasts from 15-19 March. These dresses are typically tailored and 
		hand-sewn. These traditional clothes are quite expensive, even for the 
		locals and are made of silk. The upper body is a corset like piece made 
		of silk which consists of a justillo, jubón and pañuelo. The justillo is 
		first worn and has a round/square neckline and is sleeveless. The jubón 
		is worn on top of the justillo and has long sleeves and finally the 
		pañuelo which has lace or stunning embroidery done and will be worn to 
		cover the shoulders and neckline.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

		an apron and could be made of lace or other sheer fabrics like cotton.<o:p></o:p></p>
